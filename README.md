# Get Iframe Source Content

This JavaScript library helps you to extract the source content of an iframe.

## Usage


### 1 - Default Mode

You can use this library on default mode just downloading this code and executing the ```index.html``` file, after that you can insert your iframe code on the input.

### 2 - Custom Mode 

1. You can download or clone this repository and copy just the script file: ```js/index.js```.

2. After that, add the script on your code calling it after the main ```html``` code and before the closing ```</body>```, example:

    ```
    <script src="youtpath/js/index.js"></script>
    ```
3. Add the ```data-action``` attribute on your input element, example:
    ```
    <input type="text" data-action="get-iframe-src" />
    ```

Enjoy it!
